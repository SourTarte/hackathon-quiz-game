Designed with accessibility and replayability in mind, Quizia appeals to a broad audience (recommended age 13+). Users can tailor their experience by adjusting difficulty, quiz length, and subject matter, ensuring that each session feels fresh and engaging.

## How It Works

Quizia keeps the user journey simple and engaging, guiding players through three clear steps:

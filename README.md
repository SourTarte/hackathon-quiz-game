# Quizia

## Introduction

Quizia is an interactive online quiz application built during a hackathon by the **Quizia team**.  
It was developed collaboratively to challenge users’ general knowledge as well as subject-specific topics, while showcasing teamwork, design thinking, and rapid prototyping.  

Designed with accessibility and replayability in mind, Quizia appeals to a broad audience (recommended age 13+). Users can tailor their experience by adjusting difficulty, quiz length, and subject matter, ensuring that each session feels fresh and engaging.

## How It Works

Quizia keeps the user journey simple and engaging, guiding players through three clear steps:

- **Step 1 – Enter Your Name**  
  Users start by entering their name. After this, they are presented with quiz options such as category, difficulty, and quiz length. Once ready, they simply click **Play!**  

- **Step 2 – Answer Questions**  
  Each quiz question offers four possible answers (or True/False mode). Only one answer is correct, making the gameplay straightforward yet challenging.  

- **Step 3 – View Results & Share**  
  Once the quiz ends, results are shown instantly. Players can then challenge friends to beat their score, encouraging replayability and social engagement.

## Wireframes

Before moving to development, the team created wireframes for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.  
These helped us quickly iterate on layout ideas, ensure responsiveness, and keep a consistent structure across devices.  

**Desktop Wireframe**

These wireframes evolved into the final polished UI showcased above, but they gave us a solid foundation to work quickly and collaboratively.  

## Project Management (Agile Board)

To keep our team organized during the hackathon, we used a **Kanban board** on GitHub Projects.  
This helped us prioritize tasks, track progress, and stay aligned as a team working under tight deadlines.  

**Board Columns:**
- **To Do:** Tasks that were identified but not yet started.  
- **In Progress:** Tasks currently being developed.  
- **Done:** Completed features that were merged and tested.  

**Prioritization:**
- We used labels like *must-have*, *should-have*, and *could-have* to prioritize tasks.  
- Critical features (e.g., Welcome Page, Accessibility) were tackled first to ensure core functionality.  
- Enhancements and nice-to-have features were added later if time allowed.
